# Power analysis

This function makes power analysis. It plots the power vs. the effect size for different population sizes. Note that this code doesn't take the standard deviation of the measurements into consideration.

Example:  
N = [1e3,5e3,1e4,5e4,1e5]; % Population size vector.  
power_analysis(N)

See power_analysis for more input options.
